# 4 Pillars of OOPS

Following are 4 pillars of OOPs:
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## @ Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines. It provides you the control over the data. It is a way to achieve data hiding. The whole idea behind encapsulation is to hide the implementation details from users.

Encapsulation can be achieved by using private members and public member functions (setter-getters).

#### Advantages of encapsulation
1. It improves maintainability and flexibility and re-usability.
2. The fields can be made read-only (If we don’t define setter methods) or write-only (If we don’t define the getter methods).
3. User would not be knowing what is going on behind the scene. They would only be knowing that to update a field call set method and to read a field call get method but what these set and get methods are doing is purely hidden from them.

#### Real World Example
Capsule will be our class and various medicines filled under the capsule will be our data and member functions.
