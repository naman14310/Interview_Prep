# DBMS Concepts

<br>

## Instance Vs Schema
Instance is the snapshot of the database taken at a particular moment. It can also be described in more significant way as the collection of the information stored in the database at that particular moment.

Schema is the overall description or the overall design of the database specified during the database design. Important thing to be remembered here is it should not be changed frequently.

### DQL
DQL or **Data Query Language** statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.

### DML
DML or **Data Manipulation Language** commands deals with the manipulation of data present in the database. It is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and to the database.

### DCL
DCL or **Data Control Language** includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. 

### TCL
