## [Private IP Vs Public IP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-private-and-public-ip-addresses/)
Private IP address of a system is the IP address which is used to communicate within the same network. Using private IP data or information can be sent or received within the same network. Private IP can be known by entering “ipconfig” on command prompt. It works only in LAN.		

Public IP address of a system is the IP address which is used to communicate outside the network. Public IP address is basically assigned by the ISP (Internet Service Provider). It is used to get internet service. Public IP can be known by searching “what is my ip” on google.

VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network". A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect through a specially configured remote VPN server. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data. The VPN acts as a secure tunnel between you and the internet. Your ISP and other third parties cannot detect this tunnel.This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online.

### Benefits of a VPN connection
1. Online activities are hidden even on public networks. Hide your IP address from your ISP and other third parties.
2. VPN servers act as our proxies on the internet. Our actual location cannot be determined.
3. With VPN location spoofing, we can get access to content that is retricted in our region.
4. Ensure secure data transfer.

### Types of VPN

#### 1. SSL VPN
SSL VPNs enable devices with an internet connection to establish a secure remote access VPN connection with a web browser. Enterprises use SSL VPNs to enable remote users to securely access organizational resources.

#### 2. Site to site VPN
It is designed to hide private intranets and allow users of these secure networks to access each other's resources. It is useful if you have two separate intranets between which you want to send files without users from one intranet explicitly accessing the other. Mainly used in large companies

#### 3. Client to Server VPN
Connecting via a VPN client can be imagined as if you were connecting your home PC to the company with an extension cable. This involves the user not being connected to the internet via his own ISP, but establishing a direct connection through his/her VPN provider.
