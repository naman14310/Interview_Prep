# Memory Management

<br>

### 1. Which memories are directly accessible by CPU ?
Registers and RAM

<br>

### 2. Logical Address Vs Physical Address
**Logical Address** is generated by CPU while a program is running. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU.

**Physical Address** identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user program generates the logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs physical memory for its execution, therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used.

<br>

### 3. How to convert Logical address to physical address ?
The hardware device called **Memory Management Unit** is used for mapping logical address to its corresponding physical address. 

<br>

### 4. Purpose of logical address ?
Because this gives the Operating System a way to securely manage memory. Imagine you are editing an important letter in MS Word while listening to music on YouTube on a very recently released browser. The browser is buggy and writes bogus values to a range of physical addresses that were being used by the Word program to store the edits of your letter. All of that information is corrupt!

**How can the OS prevent this?**

Maintain a mapping of physical addresses allocated to each process and make sure one process cannot access the memory allocated to another process.

<br>

### 5. Fragmentation
Fragmentation means wastage of memory.

**Internal Fragmentation**

1. Internal Fragmentation occurs due to wastage of memory inside the block in fixed memory Partitioning. 
2. Paging suffers from Internal fragmentation.

**External Fragmentation**

1. It occurs due to contiguos allocation of memory in variable partitioning.
2. Segmentation suffers from external fragmentation.

<br>

### 6. Paging increases context switch time how and why ?
OS must keep track of each individual process's page table, updating it whenever the process's pages get moved in and out of memory, and applying the correct page table when processing system calls for a particular process. This all increases the overhead involved when swapping processes in and out of the CPU. 

<br>

### 7. How Paging Works ?
Processes are divided into pages and main memory is divided into frames. Now The CPU generates the logical address, which contains the page number and the page offset. The page number is used to index into the page table, to get the corresponding page frame number, and once we have the page frame of the physical memory(also called main memory), we can apply the page offset to get the right word of memory.

<br>

### 8. Why TLB (Translation Look Aside Buffer) ?
The thing is that page table is stored in physical memory, and sometimes can be very large, so to speed up the translation of logical address to physical address, we sometimes use TLB, which is made of expensive and faster associative memory, So instead of going into page table first, we go into the TLB and use page number to index into the TLB, and get the corresponding page frame number and if it is found, we completely avoid page table( because we have both the page frame number and the page offset) and form the physical address.

**TLB Miss:** If we don't find the page frame number inside the TLB, it is called a TLB miss only then we go to the page table to look for the corresponding page frame number.

**TLB Hit:** If we find the page frame number in TLB, its called TLB hit, and we don't need to go to page table.

<br>

### 9. Page Fault
Occurs when the page accessed by a running program is not present in physical memory. It means the page is present in the secondary memory but not yet loaded into a frame of physical memory.

<br>

### 10. What is Cache Hit and Cache Miss ?
Cache Memory is a small memory that operates at a faster speed than physical memory and we always go to cache before we go to physical memory. If we are able to locate the corresponding word in cache memory inside the cache, its called **cache hit** and we don't even need to go to the physical memory. If cache memory is unable to find the corresponding block, then we go to physical memory and do all that process of going through page table or TLB.

<br> 

### 11. Whole control flow (IMP)
[Explaination](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37825859/cache-miss-a-tlb-miss-and-page-fault)

1. First go to the cache memory and if its a cache hit, then we are done.
2. If its a cache miss, go to step 3.
3. First go to TLB and if its a TLB hit, go to physical memory using physical address formed, we are done.
4. If its a TLB miss, then go to page table to get the frame number of your page for forming the physical address.
5. If the page  is not found, its a page fault. Use one of the page replacement algorithms if all the frames are occupied by some page else just load the required page from secondary memory to physical memory frame.

<br>

### 12. Swapping
Swapping is a memory management technique and is used to temporarily remove the inactive programs from the main memory of the computer system.  Due to the swapping technique performance usually gets affected, but it also helps in running multiple and big processes in parallel. 

**Advantages of swapping**
1. It helps the CPU to manage multiple processes within a single main memory.
2. It helps to create and use virtual memory.

**Disadvantages of swapping**
1. If the algorithm used for swapping is not good then the overall method can increase the number of page faults and thus decline the overall performance of processing.
2. If the computer system loses power at the time of high swapping activity then the user might lose all the information related to the program.

<br>

### 13. Virtual Memory
Virtual memory is a technique that allows the execution of processes that are not completely in memory.

**Need of Virtual Memory**
1. This allows execution of programs larger than the memory.
2. This allows higher degree of multiprogramming.

<br>

### 14. Demand Paging 
Demand paging is an approach to implement virtual memory. Pages are loaded into the memory only when the CPU wants to access them. We use a program called **lazy swapper** (also known as pager).

**Pure Demand Paging**

Pure demand paging is an extreme case of demand paging where the execution of a process is started with none of its pages in memory.

<br>

### 15. Locality of Reference
Locality of Reference refers to the tendency of the computer program to access instructions whose addresses are near one another. The property of locality of reference is mainly shown by loops and subroutine calls in a program.

<br>

### 16. Which page replacement algo suffers from Belady anamoly ?
FIFO, becoz it not stack algorithm.

**Stack Algorithm did not show Belady anamoly**

A page replacement algorithm is a stack algorithm if we can show that the pages in memory for n frames is always a subset of pages in memory that will be there in memory for (n+1) frames. Optimal and LRU are stack algorithms.

<br>

### 17. Thrashing (IMP)
Thrashing is a situation when a system is spending more time in servicing page faults than execution. The actual processing done is very negligible. 

<br>

**How Thrashing occurs**

The basic concept involved is that if a process is allocated too few frames, then there will be too many and too frequent page faults. As a result, no useful work would be done by the CPU and the CPU utilisation would fall drastically. The long-term scheduler would then try to improve the CPU utilisation by loading some more processes into the memory thereby increasing the degree of multiprogramming. This would result in a further decrease in the CPU utilization triggering a chained reaction of higher page faults followed by an increase in the degree of multiprogramming, called Thrashing.

### 18. How can we handle thrashing ?
Following approaches can be used to control thrashing:

**1. Use Local Page replacement algorithm**

Local page replacement will select pages which only belongs to that process. Due to this, there is a chance of a reduction in the thrashing.

<br>

**2. Working-Set Model**

It is based on the concept of the Locality Model. A locality is a set of pages that are actively used together. It states that if we allocate enough frames to a process to accommodate its current locality, it will only fault whenever it moves to some new locality. But if the allocated frames are lesser than the size of the current locality, the process is bound to thrash. 

<br>

**3. Control Page Fault Frequency**

If the page fault rate is too high, it indicates that the process has too few frames allocated to it. On the contrary, a low page fault rate indicates that the process has too many frames. 

![img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/1-161.png)

Upper and lower limits can be established on the desired page fault rate as shown in the diagram. If the page fault rate falls below the lower limit, frames can be removed from the process. Similarly, if the page fault rate exceeds the upper limit, more number of frames can be allocated to the process. 

Note: If the page fault rate is high with no free frames, then some of the processes can be suspended and frames allocated to them can be reallocated to other processes. The suspended processes can then be restarted later.
